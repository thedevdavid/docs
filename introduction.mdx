## What is this?

Supabase and Next.js components and code snippets that you can copy and paste into your apps. Customizable. Open Source.

As other similar collections, like @shadcn/ui, this is also NOT a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

Use this as a reference to build on top of.
